                <div>
                    <p>Kali is one of the most most popular and a Linux distro preferred by offensive security It has all the tools required organized in a very orderly manner. I prefer to use this as there are new updates given in regular intervals. Kali is an open-source distro and it is built on debian which is a really fast distro in its own right.</p>
                    <p>Kali tools : Kali Linux contains a large number of penetration testing tools from various different niches of the security and forensics fields. This site aims to list them all and provide a quick reference to these tools. In addition, the versions of the tools can be tracked against their upstream sources. Here is the tool listing website kali.org</p>
                    <p>Kali metapackages : Metapackages give you the flexibility to install specific subsets of tools based on your particular needs. For instance, if you are going to conduct a wireless security assessment, you can quickly create a custom Kali ISO and include the kali-linux-wireless metapackage to only install the tools you need.</p>
                    <h3>kali advantages :</h3>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc"></ul>
                    <li>Advanced Penetration Testing tools : In the Kali Linux, more than 500+ advanced Penetration Testing tools are included. The tools of BackTrack Linux which are not up to the mark or repeated in many ways has been replaced in the Kali Linux system with the advanced penetration testing tools.                  </li>
                    <li>Free Linux tool : The Kali Linux system is totally free like the BackTrack Linux and will always offer their users the free life time services. This is huge plus factor which forces people to use this system.                      </li>
                    <li>Open sourced Git : This Kali Linux is an openly sourced system and can be easily accessed by the users. All the codes in the Kali Linux can be viewed easily by anyone and the open development source makes easy to view the development of coding at every step.                    </li>
                    <li>Support : Kali address to the File-system Hierarchy Standard, allowing Linux users to easily locate binaries, support files, libraries, etc. This is the very important feature of the Kali Linux that makes it stand out among the other Linux systems. The new update has made Kali Linux more user friendlyfriendly.              </li>

                    <li>KALI is not as easy to use, because it’s penetration oriented, you will find all the tools you will need.                  </li>
                    <li>KALI is not exactly the most training oriented Linux. You will need to find Wiki sources                      </li>
                    <li>In the process of using KALI for NORMAL computing, you may trash some of KALI’s specialized settings for it’s own security.                      </li>
